Most die hard Apple fans, creators and developers alike will tell you "get the LG  UltraFine 5k monitor" or say something like "Why don''t you get the Pro Display XDR?". My answer to that is "why do I need to spend thousands on a monitor when a 1440p one does the trick? This is also not my only monitor, thanks to my work place, I also run two 27" 4k monitors either side of this one (one of them is event in portrait, too!! üò±).'

Since the Samsung monitor is mountable out-of-the-box, I only needed two monitor arms for the LG monitors. There's enough clearance underneath to comfortably hold a 27\" monitor in portrait orientation. You can seem them in good use in the photo at the top of this page."

But like the Magic Keyboard, I started getting cramps for prolngued periods of use ‚Äì maybe it's my age üòÖ ‚Äì but the MX 3 has taken the crown for me, it's comortable, customisable and has a very good battery life, the clear alternative."

So this time, I did my research; I dove onto reddit, spent countless hours on YouTube at 2am watching people review mic arms. The Elgato Wave really caught my eye, because of its a low-profile, fold out-of-the-way style. It's perfect for holding the AKG and it's not visually unappealing, either."

![My Desk](assets/images/desk.jpg)

I use a lot of things. The most common question I get asked when I show people my desk setup is "Nice, what are you using?" So I thought it would be a good idea to put everything onto one page and tell you what I use and what I recommend. Here's a couple photo's of my current setup:
