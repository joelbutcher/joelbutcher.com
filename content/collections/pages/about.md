I work as a Fullstack Software Engineering for a company calledÂ [Superscript](https://gosuperscript.com/), the UKâ€™s first FCA approved InsurTech company transforming business insurance using cutting-edge technology. I specialise in Laravel PHP, but being a frontend developer, I'm also comfortable with a wide range of frontend technologies such as Vue, React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

In my spare time I like to expand my knowledge by reading inspiring books such as [Deploy Empathy by Michele Hansen](https://amzn.to/3JAHZpf), or [Clean Code by Martin C. Robert](https://amzn.to/3ZCkmCe) ðŸ“–, share my knowledge, experiences, tips & tricks on [my blog](https://joelbutcher.com/blog) ðŸ““, spend time with family or hang out with friends , or play guitar ðŸŽ¸. I have a broad range of music tastes from some of the latest bangers to the old classics like Hotel California by The Eagles.

I'm a worship guitarist and play on the worship team at my local church, [Alive](https://alivechurch.org.uk), where I'm also a sound engineer.
