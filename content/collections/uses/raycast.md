description: "I'm a power user, and constant reach to Raycast to quickly launch apps, or perform system tasks. I used to use Alfred, but since using Raycast, I've not really looked back. Having the ability to install app-specific extensions for things like Slack, TablePlus and Jira is the best thing about this Spotlight replacement."
