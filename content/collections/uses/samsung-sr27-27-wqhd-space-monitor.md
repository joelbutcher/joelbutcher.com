I initially bought this monitor because I had a very small desk to work on when the country went into lockdown in 2020 due to COVID. However, due to the high-resolution and high-refresh rate, it's become my daily driver. I am always looking at replacing it with a curved monitor, one more suited to gaming, but I just can bring myself to let go of this display!
