title: 'Reader Question: Why did you choose Statamic for your website?'
excerpt: "I've had my eye on Statamic since it first launched. Looking at my Statamic purchase history, I've been a customer since v1 but never felt the time was right to make the jump from my old system. That all changed when they launched v3 last year and moved it to a more Laravel package-style setup."
