    I currently work as a Software Engineer at Superscript 👨‍💻, the first UK InsuTech to become a Lloyd’s of London broker, they're transforming business insurance to meet the fast-changing needs of SMEs 📈.

    I'm an avid technology enthusiast 🤓, always to keeping myself up-to-date on the current tech news & developments in my field. I'm a member of the Laravel community and an open source maintainer of [Socialstream](https://docs.socialstream.dev) - the missing Socialite integration for Laravel Jetstream .

    In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, you can often find me with my axe 🎸 in hand strumming along to The Eagles, AC/DC or Guns 'n' Roses (I have a broad music taste!).
